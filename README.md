# Karma IDS
A Linux based real-time Network Intrusion Detection System which uses eBPF for live packet capturing and LSTM for a threat classification model.

# Why?
Traditional security methods might not catch an attack until after damage. eBPF's real-time monitoring allows for quicker detection and response, minimizing the impact of an attack and keeping the target safer. 
Cyberattacks often target specific organizations, but successful attacks can have ripple effects.  By strengthening overall cybersecurity, eBPF helps protect the interconnected systems that society relies on, from online banking to medical records.
Improved Cybersecurity: Our project offers a more robust intrusion detection and prevention system, leading to better protection against cyberattacks. This translates to greater security for individuals and society, as cyberattacks can target critical infrastructure and personal data. Early detection of threats can prevent data breaches. Financial losses, identity theft, and reputational damage are all potential outcomes of a data breach. Our project helps to mitigate these risks.
More Efficient Use of Security Resources: By minimizing false positives and negatives using machine learning, our system allows security teams to focus on real threats, optimizing their time and resources. 
Scalability for Growing Needs: The ability to adapt to increasing traffic and new threats is crucial in the face of constantly evolving cyber threats. Our project's scalability helps to ensure that it remains effective over time.  The user-friendly interface gives security professionals the tools to analyze network activity and act against threats effectively. This can lead to more secure systems and networks for everyone.
